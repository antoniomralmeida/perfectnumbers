In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive proper divisors, that is, divisors excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has proper divisors 1, 2 and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number. The next perfect number is 28, since 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.

The first four perfect numbers are 6, 28, 496 and 8128.

In about 300 BC Euclid showed that if 2p − 1 is prime then 2p−1(2p − 1) is perfect.
